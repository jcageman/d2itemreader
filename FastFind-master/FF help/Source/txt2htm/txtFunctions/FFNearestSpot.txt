###User Defined Function###
FFNearestSpot

###Description###
Searches a SnapShot for an area containing a minimum number of pixels of the given color, closest to the given point.

###Syntax###
FFNearestSpot ( SizeSearch, NbPixel, PosX, PosY, Color [, ShadeVariation [, ForceNewSnap [, Left [, Top [, Right [, Bottom [, NoSnapShot [, WindowHandle]]]]]]]] )

###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
SizeSearch
	The width and height of the area to search for.
NbPixel
	Minimum number of pixels in the area.
PosX
	X coordinate of proximity position.
PosY
	Y coordinate of proximity position.
Color
	Colour value of pixel to find (in decimal or hex). -1 to use the FastFind color list.
ShadeVariation
	[optional] A number between 0 and 255 to indicate the allowed number of shades of variation of the red, green, and blue components of the colour. Default is 0 (exact match).
ForceNewSnap
	[optional] If true, a new SnapShot will be made and the search will be done on that. Default is True.
Left
	[optional] Left coordinate of the new SnapShot area. Default is 0.
Top
	[optional] Top coordinate of the new SnapShot area. Default is 0.
Right
	[optional] Right coordinate of the new SnapShot area. Default is 0.
Bottom
	[optional] Bottom coordinate of the new SnapShot area. Default is 0.
NoSnapShot
	[optional] SnapShot number. Determines which "slot" the new SnapShot will be stored in.
WindowHandle
	[optional] Window handle to be used.

###ReturnValue###
@@ReturnTable@@
Success:	Returns a three-element array of area's coordinates and number of pixels found. (Array[0] = x, Array[1] = y, Array[2] = Number of pixels found).
Failure:	Returns 0 and sets @ERROR
@@End@@


###Remarks###
The coordinates returned specify the barycenter (center of mass) of the area found.

If more than one acceptable area exists within the SnapShot, this function will return the one closest to PosX, PosY. This is useful for finding clusters of pixels of a particular color. Setting the Color parameter to -1 will cause the search to match on any color in the FastFind color list.

A new SnapShot will be saved in the default slot if ForceNewSnap remains True.

FFSnapShot, FFAddColor, FFAddExcludedArea, FFGetPixel, FFNearestPixel, FFBestSpot


###Example###
Suppose you want to find clusters of 3 or more black pixels, in an area no bigger than 4x4, near the center of the SnapShot (SizeSearch = 4, NbPixel = 3, Color = 0x00000000).

In the above SnapShot, there are five possible locations that meet the criteria, however the coordinates of the green area will be returned, as it's the closest to the specified position.
